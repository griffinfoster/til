# Cat and Splat

Today I learned that `cat` supports splat (`*`).

This happened while I was trying to copy a handful of code examples to paste into a Gist, and I ran:

```
$ cat factor/examples/strings/* | pbcopy
```

This copied all the files in the `strings/` directory into my clipboard, ready to paste into the Gist.
