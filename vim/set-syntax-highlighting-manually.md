# Set Syntax Highlighting Manually

If you've opened a file with Vim and it has a weird extension (or you've just pasted code into a new file with no extension yet), you might need to set your highlighting manually. Just use `:set syntax:[language]`, for example:

```
:set syntax:javascript
```
