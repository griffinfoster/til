# Set Your Color Syntax

Vim ships with a number of different color schemes. There is also a plethora
of color schemes built by the open source community. If you'd like to know
what color scheme you are currently using, you can check with

```
:echo g:colors_name
```

Vim ships with a number of standard color schemes for both light and dark
backgrounds. You can also find and install many others. To set your color
scheme, you can use the `:colorscheme` command. You can quickly see what
color schemes are available by typing `:colorscheme` and then tabbing for
completion. For instance, you can set the *delek* color scheme by entering

```
:colorscheme delek
```

So more details at both `:h g:colors_name` and `:h colorscheme`.
